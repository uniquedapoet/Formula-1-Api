# Formula 1 Website API

This project is a Formula 1 statistics website built using a React frontend and a FastAPI backend. The application allows users to retrieve detailed information about Formula 1 drivers, circuits, and race results, as well as filter data based on custom combinations like specific circuits and drivers. It is designed to provide an easy-to-use interface for accessing historical and current data on Formula 1.

## Features
- **Driver Information**: Fetch detailed data on Formula 1 drivers.
- **Circuit Information**: Get insights on F1 circuits around the world.
- **Race Results**: Retrieve historical race results and filter based on driver, circuit, or year.
- **Dynamic Filters**: Combine filters to narrow down results.
- **Seamless Frontend-Backend Integration**: Smooth interaction between React and FastAPI.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, JavaScript, HTML/CSS
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python), Pydantic, SQLAlchemy (or your preferred database)
- **Database**: SQLite, PostgreSQL, or any SQL-compliant database
- **API Documentation**: Swagger UI (automatically generated by FastAPI)

## Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (for the React frontend)
- Python 3.9+ (for the FastAPI backend)
- Virtual environment setup (recommended for backend)
- Git installed for cloning the repository

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/uniquedapoet/Formula-1-Website-Api.git
    cd Formula-1-Website-Api
    ```

### Backend Setup (FastAPI)
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
    ```sh
    cd backend
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

The backend will be available at [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000). You can access the automatically generated Swagger UI docs at [http://127.0.0.1:5000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:5000/docs).

### Frontend Setup (React)
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
    ```sh
    cd ../frontend
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the React development server:
    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

The frontend will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## API Endpoints
Here’s a quick overview of some key API endpoints:

- **GET /drivers**: Get a list of all drivers
- **GET /circuits**: Get a list of all circuits
- **GET /results**: Get a list of race results
- **GET /drivers/{driver_id}**: Get details of a specific driver
- **GET /circuits/{circuit_id}**: Get details of a specific circuit
- **GET /results?year={year}**: Filter results by year
- **GET /results?driver={id}**: Filter results by driver
- **GET /results?circuit={id}**: Filter results by circuit

Additional filter combinations (like driver + circuit + year) are also supported.

## Usage
To get both servers running you can navigate to the frontend directory and run `npm start`, you can access the Formula 1 statistics website at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You’ll be able to:
- Browse drivers and circuits.
- Apply filters to view specific race results.
- Explore detailed statistics on the Formula 1 season.
